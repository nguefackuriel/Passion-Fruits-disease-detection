# Passion-Fruits-disease-detection

Passion fruit pests and diseases in Uganda lead to reduced yields and decreased investment in farming over time. Most Ugandan farmers (including passion fruit farmers) are smallholder farmers from low-income households, and do not have sufficient information and means to combat these challenges. Without the required knowledge about the health of their crops, farmers cannot intervene promptly to avoid devastating losses.

In this project, we design an android app to detect monkeypox.
To train our model, we used 816 images for the class Brownspot, 450nimages for the class Healthy and
869 images for the class Woodiness. We train the algorithm on the Passio Mobile AI Platform
and we have obtained an accuracy of 81% on the training set and 99% on the test set.

You can download the app in the folder app -> build -> outputs -> apk -> debug

You can test the algorithm using some of the images uploaded in this project.

You can also see some results obtained by testing the app on some images
